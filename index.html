     <div class="Cntr1" style="color: white;">Hi! I am Ashmit Pandey , a student of Computer Science and Information Technology branch in Ajay Kumar Garg Engineering College ,I am from Lucknow , the city of Nawabs, 
         I love to play games , some of my favourite ones being the Mass effect Trilogy , the Elder Scrolls 5 Skyrim and Saints Row IV. I play competitive games as well and have more than 2k 
         hrs on Counter Strike Global Offensive , Aside from games i avidly watch animes , my favourite genre being Slice of Life but ironically my favourite anime Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann 
         belongs to the Mecha Genre . I also sketch a bit but not much. Computer Science has been my favourite subject since 10th grade , cuz that was the time i discovered that Coding is actually pretty straightforward
         and simple and if i know the logic i have solved the problem , people say that there are no shortcuts but i guess coding is one of the biggest shortcuts there can be . Machine Learning has always been a topic 
         has intrigued me it fascinates me and i think its going to be the main 'BIG TECH' of the future. Aside from that i am bit lazy and i tend to push things to the last minute possible but still i get the job done 
         somehow eventually.
